    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bulgur wheat is eaten a lot in the Middle East and South Asia but for tonight's dinner we've teamed it with sweet and sour pork, which you might normally expect to find with rice. Try it - we think you'll love the change!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ vegetable stock pot</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>150g bulgur wheat</li>
        <li>3 spring onions</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp ketjap manis</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 pork loin fillets</li>
        <li>½ yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>½ red bell pepper</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the water in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the vegetable stock pot, stir to dissolve then add the bulgur wheat. Cover with a lid, remove from the heat and leave for 10-15 mins, or until the water has completely soaked into the wheat. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel and grate the garlic (or use a garlic press). Halve, then remove the cores from the peppers and chop into bitesized chunks. Remove the root from the spring onion and thinly slice, separating the white and green parts.</li>
        <li>Cut the pork into bite-sized cubes. Sprinkle the cornflour into a mixing bowl and add a generous pinch of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Add the pork and toss to coat thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Heat a splash of oil in a frying pan over high heat. Line a plate with some kitchen paper. When the pan is hot, add half the pork. Stir-fry until browned, 4 mins. Transfer to the lined plate to absorb any excess oil. Add a little more oil to the pan and fry the remaining pork in the same way.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar with a sprinkling of sugar (if you have some). Stir until the sugar has dissolved and then set aside. Wash the frying pan you used for the pork, add a splash of oil and put it on medium heat. Stir-fry the peppers for 4 mins. Add the garlic and the whites of the spring onion. Cook for another minute. Stir in the vinegar mixture and the ketjap manis and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Return the pork to the pan and stir thoroughly. Continue cooking until the pork is piping hot and cooked through, for 2-3 mins. Serve the sweet and sour pork alongside the bulgur wheat and sprinkle over the greens of the spring onion. Enjoy!</li>
